## My process
I built the HTML and CSS with mobile responsiveness in mind. Which made it easier for me to build it desktop responsiveness.

I used flex to ease the responsiveness for me.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsiveness
- Google fonts


### What I learned

I learned more about responsiveness in general and how to focus on desktop vs mobile responsiveness. 

### Continued development

I want to continue developing rsponsive websites in a better way. I will be focusing on making my code more readable and easy to understand while keeping in mind performance.
